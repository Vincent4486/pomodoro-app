# 🍅 Pomodoro App
### Plan. Focus. Done.

**Pomodoro App** is a macOS productivity app that connects focus sessions, Tasks, Reminders, and Calendar into a single workflow.  
It is not just a timer — it links tasks, time, and focus, adapting to task-driven, time-blocking, or flow-based work styles. Pomodoro is built as a unified time system rather than a rigid productivity method, with a macOS-inspired **glass / liquid glass UI**.

Version **1.1.0** is a feature integration update that deepens system connections without a full redesign.

## 🚀 Try it now

Download the latest release from GitHub and run the app immediately: see Pomodoro v1.1.0 for the current build. Future releases will appear under Releases.

- **Gatekeeper warning**: macOS may warn that the app is from an unidentified developer. This is expected while the project awaits Apple Developer Program approval.
- **Bypass Gatekeeper safely**: follow the step‑by‑step guide in `docs/Gatekeeper.md` to open the downloaded app without compromising security.

Once the Apple developer account is active, signed TestFlight and App Store builds will be provided.

## ✨ Why Pomodoro App is different

Pomodoro App is designed as a unified time system — not just a timer. It brings together focus sessions, tasks, reminders, and calendar blocks into **one single workflow**, so planning and execution live in the same place.

Instead of forcing a rigid productivity method, Pomodoro App **adapts to how you actually work — whether that’s time-blocking, task-driven planning, or flow-based focus**.

## 🧰 Running & Developing

### Running the app

If you prefer not to build from source, download the binary from the latest release (see “Try it now” above). On first launch, macOS may block the app; use the Gatekeeper guide linked above.

### Building from source

Requires Xcode on macOS 14.6 or later.
Clone this repository, open the project in Xcode, and build/run as usual.

**Requirements:** <br>
- GoogleSignIn (>= 7.1.0)
- AppAuth 1.7.6
- GTMAppAuth 4.1.1
- GTMSessionFetcher 3.5.0
- Xcode on macOS 14.6 or later

This project uses Swift Package Manager to manage dependencies. <br>
The current version is fully native Swift; legacy Tauri/Svelte/Python versions are archived.

>## ⚠️ Firebase Config File Usage

>This repository does **NOT** contain a real Firebase configuration.
>
>### ⚠️ DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED FILE
>
>Any GoogleService-Info.plist file in this repository is a **placeholder** and exists only so the project can compile in CI.

## 🕰️ Legacy Systems (Archived)

Pomodoro has gone through multiple architectural stages during its development.
All previous implementations are preserved **for reference only** and are no longer
part of the active product direction.

Legacy see: https://github.com/T-1234567890/Pomodoro-legacy

**Status**
- ❌ Deprecated
- ❌ Prototype only
- ❌ No longer representative of the project
- ❌ No longer maintained

The current mainline version of Pomodoro is **fully native Swift (macOS)**.

---

### Legacy System A — Tauri + Svelte + Python (0.5.x – 0.7.x)

This version introduced a modern desktop architecture before the move to native Swift.

**Stack**
- Frontend: Svelte
- Desktop shell: Tauri
- Backend: Python (Pomodoro engine)
- IPC: JSON-based bridge between frontend and backend

**Reason for deprecation**
While functional, this architecture:
- Added unnecessary complexity on macOS
- Limited deep system integration
- Did not fully match macOS performance and UX expectations

The project has since migrated to **native Swift** for clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

---

### Legacy System B — Python + Tkinter UI (≤ 0.4.x)

This was the **original prototype** used during the earliest stages of development.

**Stack**
- Python
- Tkinter UI
- Single-process desktop app

## 🏗️ Working on

### 🖥️ Native liquid glass UI/UX
An upcoming release for the native liquid glass support (currently macOS 15 style)

---

### 🔔 Reminders (Improvements)
Continuing to extend the in-app reminder system introduced in v1.1.0 to gently notify users of important
events without breaking focus.

Current direction:
- Feedback
- General update

The reminder system is intended to complement the Pomodoro workflow,
not replace it or become distracting.

## Docs

- Future planning: `docs/Future_Pro_Plan.md`
- Development roadmap: `docs/Roadmap_1.0-2.0.md`
- FAQ & design decisions: `docs/FAQ.md`
- Gatekeeper & installation notes: `docs/Gatekeeper.md`

### Long-term Future Directions

**Pomodoro App is free**.

A small number of long-term ideas (AI features, cloud sync, deeper analytics) are being brainstormed.  
**No paid plan exists at this stage.**
