# Pomodoro Timer

This repository contains a simple Pomodoro desktop application written in Python using `tkinter`.

## Features

- Customizable work and break durations
- Start, pause/resume, and reset controls
- Popup notification when a session finishes
- Tracks how many Pomodoros you have completed today
- Displays remaining time
- Works offline on macOS (Python and tkinter are usually included)
- Optional dark mode for late-night sessions

## Usage

Run the application with Python 3:

```bash
python3 pomodoro.py
```

The first time a work session completes, the count for the current day increases. The count is stored in `pomodoro_data.json` in the same directory.
