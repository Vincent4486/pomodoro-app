# Pomodoro App · FAQ

This FAQ answers common questions about Pomodoro App’s design choices, scope, and future direction.

---

## What is Pomodoro App?

Pomodoro App is a **desktop-first macOS focus and planning tool**.

It combines:
- A lightweight Pomodoro / focus timer
- Task management
- Calendar & Reminders integration
- A distraction-reduced Flow Mode

The goal is not to replace existing tools, but to **bring focus, structure, and reflection together** in a calm desktop environment.

---

## Is Pomodoro App free?

Yes.

Pomodoro App is currently **free and open source**, and all core features remain free:
- Timer and focus sessions
- Tasks
- Calendar & Reminders integration
- Menu bar support
- Local-first data storage

There is **no active subscription**, and no paid features today.

---

## Is there a Pro or Plus plan?

No — not at this stage.

You may see documents discussing **future Pro / Plus ideas**, but these are:
- Exploratory
- Long-term
- Not scheduled
- Not implemented

They exist to **share transparent thinking early**, not to announce pricing or lock features behind paywalls.

---

## Why talk about future paid plans at all?

Some future ideas (AI features, cloud services, cross-device sync) involve **ongoing infrastructure costs**.

If such features are ever introduced, a paid plan may exist **only to sustain development**, not to restrict the core app.

Pomodoro App aims to avoid:
- Surprise paywalls
- Feature removal
- Breaking existing workflows

---

## Why doesn’t Pomodoro App have an iOS or mobile app?

This is an intentional design choice.

Pomodoro App is built for **deep work**, which is better supported on a desktop:
- Larger screen
- Keyboard-driven workflows
- Fewer interruptions
- Longer attention spans

Mobile devices are optimized for quick interactions and notifications, which often conflict with focused work.

For this reason, Pomodoro App does **not plan to offer a full mobile app** in the foreseeable future.

---

## How do I add tasks or events on my phone?

Mobile workflows are supported through **Apple’s system apps**:

- **Apple Reminders** — quick task capture
- **Apple Calendar** — scheduling and time blocks

Pomodoro App syncs with Calendar and Reminders, allowing you to:
1. Capture tasks or events on your phone
2. Review, organize, and focus on them later on your Mac

This keeps mobile usage lightweight while preserving a focused desktop experience.

---

## Does Pomodoro App sync data to the cloud?

Currently:
- Data is stored **locally**
- Calendar and Reminders are synced via Apple’s system frameworks

Future cloud sync ideas (e.g. backups, optional cross-device sync) are **exploratory only** and not implemented.

---

## What is “Bring Your Own AI Key” (BYO)?

In the future, Pomodoro App may support a **Bring Your Own AI Key** mode for advanced users.

This would allow users to:
- Use their own AI provider
- Experiment with AI features locally
- Avoid managed services

BYO mode would be:
- Read-only
- Advisory
- User-controlled

System-level automation would remain excluded.

---

## Is Pomodoro App open source?

Yes.

The client application is open source and developed in the open.

If cloud or AI services are introduced in the future, those components may be separated for security reasons.

---

## Is Pomodoro App available on the Mac App Store?

Not yet.

Current distribution is via **GitHub Releases**.  
The app is unsigned, and macOS Gatekeeper may show a warning on first launch.

A signed App Store or TestFlight release may happen in the future, but it is not a prerequisite for ongoing development.

---

## Is Pomodoro App stable?

Pomodoro App is under active development.

Minor releases focus on:
- Sync stability
- UI improvements
- Performance and reliability

Feedback and bug reports are welcome.

---

## Where can I learn more about future plans?

- Development roadmap: `docs/Roadmap_1.0-2.0.md`
- Long-term ideas: `docs/Future_Pro_Plan.md`

These documents describe **directional thinking**, not commitments.

---

## How can I contribute?

You can contribute by:
- Reporting bugs
- Sharing feedback
- Suggesting ideas
- Submitting pull requests

Even usage feedback helps guide development.

---

## Final note

Pomodoro App is a long-term project.

It prioritizes:
- Focus over feature count
- Sustainability over growth hacks
- Transparency over surprises

Thank you for trying it.
