# Pomodoro App · Future Plans (Long-Term, Exploratory)

> ⚠️ This document describes **long-term, forward-looking ideas** for Pomodoro App.  
> None of the features below are implemented today, and **no payment is required** at the current stage.

Pomodoro App started as a lightweight, local macOS focus tool.  
Over time, the project may gradually explore features that require **cloud services, AI APIs, or ongoing infrastructure costs**.

This document exists to:
- Share transparent long-term thinking
- Collect early feedback
- Avoid surprise paywalls in the future

---

## Status Summary

- Current version: **v1.x.x**
- Distribution: GitHub Releases (unsigned)
- Business model: **Free and Open Source**
- Subscription plans: **Not launched / Not scheduled**

This is a **future concept**, not a commitment.

---

## Why Paid Plans Might Exist (In the Far Future)

Pomodoro App is designed to remain useful without payment.

However, some ideas under exploration go beyond what a fully local, offline app can reasonably sustain long-term:

- AI-assisted reflection and summaries
- Writing- and notes-focused AI features
- Social or comparative features (e.g. leaderboards)
- Long-term data aggregation and insights

These introduce **real, recurring costs** (API usage, servers, maintenance).  
Any paid plan would exist only to **sustain development**, not to restrict core usage.

---

## Bring Your Own AI Key (Outside Subscription Plans)

For advanced or experimental users, Pomodoro App may explore a **Bring Your Own AI Key** (BYO) mode.

This mode is intended for users who prefer to:
- Use their own AI provider (OpenAI or compatible APIs)
- Avoid managed services
- Experiment with AI features independently

### Scope & Limitations

- BYO mode is **not part of Plus or Pro**
- AI is **read-only by design**
- AI may provide:
  - Advice
  - Reflection
  - Suggestions
- AI **cannot** modify:
  - Tasks
  - Calendar events
  - Schedules
  - Time blocks

All AI output is treated as **assistance**, not control.

### Philosophy

The goal is to keep this mode:
- Transparent
- User-controlled
- Low-risk

System-level automation (such as scheduling or calendar writes) is intentionally excluded and reserved for managed solutions.

---

## Possible Subscription Structure (Exploratory)

> All items below are **ideas**, not promises.

### Plus — Core Tool + Light AI (Primary Tier)

Plus is envisioned as the **main supported tier**, covering most advanced functionality beyond the free core.

Possible Plus features may include:
- Full Flow Mode experience
- AI-assisted task drafting and rewriting
- Lightweight productivity advice
- Daily / weekly summaries
- Local-first analytics and charts
- Managed AI services using cost-efficient models

Plus focuses on **enhancing the existing workflow**, not changing how users plan or decide.

---

### Pro — Includes Plus + Notes & Deep AI (Later Stage)

Pro is envisioned as a **superset of Plus**, aimed at deeper thinking and writing.

Pro may include everything in Plus, plus:
- Notes and reflection analysis
- Writing-focused AI assistance
- Cross-task and long-term insights
- Higher-quality AI models for lower-frequency, deeper use

Pro features are expected to arrive **significantly later** (e.g. v3.0+) and are not part of near-term planning.

---

## Flow Mode (Core Experience)

Flow Mode represents the long-term vision of Pomodoro App as a **focused workspace**, not just a timer.

In its more complete form, Flow Mode may include:
- A large, customizable clock for visual time awareness
- Optional small countdown timer for session-based work
- Automatic fullscreen entry to reduce distractions
- Background blur or dimming
- Custom background images or wallpapers
- Minimal UI with keyboard-first interaction

Flow Mode is designed to feel like an environment, not a control panel.

Some advanced customization options may eventually be reserved for paid tiers, while the core Flow experience remains accessible.

---

## Additional Feature Ideas (Might requires different levels of subscriptions, Exploratory)

### Task States (Beyond Completion)

Tasks may support multiple states beyond simple completion:
- Planned
- In Progress
- Paused / Parked
- Completed

These states aim to:
- Reduce binary pressure
- Reflect real-world workflows
- Improve daily and weekly review experiences

---

### AI-Assisted Planning & Reflection
- Focus summaries
- Pattern observations
- Overload or imbalance detection

> Would rely on external AI APIs → likely managed tiers only.

---

### Advanced Productivity Analytics
- Extended charts across weeks or months
- Pattern recognition (focus vs. distraction)
- Long-term trend analysis

> Visualization would remain local; aggregation may use optional services.

---

### Optional Cloud Features
- Backup & restore
- Optional leaderboards or shared statistics
- Cross-device sync (initially via iCloud)

---

### Personalization & Focus Environment
- Custom home backgrounds or images
- Extended theming options
- Advanced Flow focus modes (non-Pomodoro)

---

### AI Advice & Reflection
- Daily or weekly focus feedback
- Overload or imbalance warnings
- Pattern observations (e.g. over-scheduling, task drift)

---

### AI-Assisted Task Writing
- Convert rough ideas into structured tasks
- Improve clarity (title, description, optional steps)
- Suggest estimated effort or focus type

---

### AI-to-Task Creation
- Translate unstructured input into actionable tasks
- Tasks are **drafted**, not automatically scheduled

---

## Non-Goals

The following are **explicitly not goals**:

- Fully autonomous scheduling without user approval
- AI silently modifying calendars or tasks
- Replacing user decision-making

Pomodoro App aims to assist focus, not override it.

---

## What Is Expected to Stay Free

Pomodoro App should remain useful without payment:
- Core timer and focus features
- Tasks, Calendar, and Reminders integration
- Menu bar support
- Local-first data storage

The app should never become unusable without a subscription.

---

## Privacy & Philosophy

- Local-first by default
- Minimal data collection
- No selling user data
- AI requests are scoped and non-persistent
- No dark patterns or forced upgrades

---

## Estimated Pricing (Very Early Draft)

> Pricing below is **illustrative only** and may change.

### Plus
- **US / International**
  - $4.99 / month
  - $39 / year
- **China**
  - ¥29 / month
  - ¥229 / year

### Pro (Includes Plus)
- **US / International**
  - $7.99 / month
  - $69 / year
- **China**
  - ¥49 / month
  - ¥399 / year

## Notes Direction (v3.0+, Early Exploration)

Notes are **not part of the current 1.x or 2.x scope**.

If introduced, a Notes system would arrive no earlier than **v3.0**, and would evolve Pomodoro App from a pure focus tool into a **time-aware thinking space**.

### Positioning: Time-linked Knowledge Notes

Notes are envisioned as:
- More **knowledge-base–like** than simple reflections
- More **structured** than plain text notes
- Strongly **connected to time**, tasks, and focus sessions

They are designed to help users:
- Capture ideas while working
- Accumulate understanding over time
- Review how thinking evolves alongside actual work

Notes are **not meant to replace** full-featured tools like Notion or Obsidian, but to serve a **different purpose**:
thinking *with* time, not organizing everything.

### Relationship to Time & Tasks

Unlike traditional note apps, Notes may:
- Be linked to focus sessions, days, or weeks
- Reference tasks or projects implicitly
- Surface notes based on *when* work happened, not just where they are stored

Time acts as a **primary dimension**, not just metadata.

### Assistant, Not Automation

Notes may include an **AI assistant layer**, but with a clear boundary:

- AI can help:
  - Rewrite or clarify notes
  - Summarize longer entries
  - Extract key points
  - Suggest follow-up questions or themes
- AI cannot:
  - Automatically restructure the knowledge base
  - Enforce rigid schemas
  - Replace user intent or writing style

The assistant supports **thinking and writing**, not system-level automation.

### Knowledge Without Heavy Structure

The Notes system is expected to remain:
- Lightweight
- Low-friction
- Opinionated but flexible

Likely characteristics:
- Minimal hierarchy
- Optional tagging
- No complex databases or block programming
- Emphasis on review, recall, and continuity

### Relationship to Pro Plan

Because Notes involve:
- Larger text context
- Higher-quality AI models
- Longer-term data handling

Advanced Notes features and their AI assistance are currently envisioned as **Pro-only**, and **significantly later** than core Plus features.

### Non-Goals

Notes are explicitly **not intended** to:
- Become a full documentation platform
- Compete feature-for-feature with Notion
- Replace existing personal knowledge systems

The goal is to support **knowledge formed through focused work**, not to store everything.

---

> Notes are considered a **long-term evolution** of Pomodoro App,  
> extending focus into understanding — without turning the app into a general workspace.

---

## Final Notes

This plan represents **directional thinking**, not a roadmap.

Pomodoro App is developed as a long-term project:
- Stability over growth hacks
- Sustainability over rapid monetization
- Transparency over surprise changes

Feedback and discussion are welcome.
