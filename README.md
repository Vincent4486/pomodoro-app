# 🍅 Orchestrana™
### Plan. Focus. Done.

**Orchestrana** is a macOS productivity app that connects focus sessions, Tasks, Reminders, and Calendar into a single workflow.  
It is not just a timer — it links tasks, time, and focus, adapting to task-driven, time-blocking, or flow-based work styles. Orchestrana is built as a unified time system rather than a rigid productivity method, with a macOS-inspired **glass / liquid glass UI**.

## ✨ Why Orchestrana is different

Orchestrana is designed as a unified time system — not just a timer. It brings together focus sessions, tasks, reminders, and calendar blocks into **one single workflow**, so planning and execution live in the same place.

Instead of forcing a rigid productivity method, Orchestrana **adapts to how you actually work — whether that’s time-blocking, task-driven planning, or flow-based focus**.

## 🧰 Running & Developing

### Running the app

If you prefer not to build from source, download the binary from the latest release (see “Try it now” above). On first launch, macOS may block the app; use the Gatekeeper guide linked above.

### Building from source

Requires Xcode on macOS 14.6 or later.
Clone this repository, open the project in Xcode, and build/run as usual.

**Requirements:** <br>
- Firebase iOS SDK 12.9.0 or later
  (Swift Package Manager should automatically download gRPC, GoogleUtilities, etc. for you)
- Xcode on macOS 14.6 or later

This project uses Swift Package Manager to manage dependencies. <br>
The current version is fully native Swift; legacy Tauri/Svelte/Python versions are archived.

>## ⚠️ Firebase Config File Usage
>
>This repository does **NOT** contain a real Firebase configuration.
>
>### ⚠️ DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED FILE
>
>Any GoogleService-Info.plist file in this repository is a **placeholder** and exists only so the project can compile in CI.
>
>If you need to run your own Firebase instance, please follow these steps:
>1. Create your own Firebase project
>2. Download your own `GoogleService-Info.plist`
>3. Replace the existing file locally for your environment
>4. **Never commit your own plist file to the repository**
>
>See Example:
>`GoogleService-Info.plist.sample`

## Version status/Release Notes

For full details on updates, see the release notes on **TestFlight** or **App Store**.

👉 TestFlight & App Store release notes are the new source for version changes and updates.

### 📌 Update Policy
- Will receive more updates
- Changes may occur without notice
- Feedback, PR, and issue reports are welcome
- Will be on TestFlight or App Store

## 🤖 AI Features (Developer Preview)

AI-powered features are currently being deployed and are in **private developer preview**.

At the moment, these features are only available to **authorized developer accounts** for internal testing.  
A small number of additional testers may be invited during this stage.

The full AI feature set is planned to be **officially released in version 2.0.0**.

## Current UI Direction

The current UI uses a structured glass tile system inspired by macOS 26 (liquid glass). <br>
The goal of upcoming versions is to transition toward a softer, macOS-inspired liquid glass look — with more subtle contrast, improved typography, and refined panel depth.

## 🛠️ Project status

- Stable for daily use
- Design iterations are ongoing
- New features are in development

## 🕰️ Legacy Systems (Archived)

Orchestrana has gone through multiple architectural stages during its development.
All previous implementations are preserved **for reference only** and are no longer
part of the active product direction.

Legacy see: https://github.com/T-1234567890/Pomodoro-legacy

**Status**
- ❌ Deprecated
- ❌ Prototype only
- ❌ No longer representative of the project
- ❌ No longer maintained

The current mainline version of Orchestrana is **fully native Swift (macOS)**.

<details>

### Legacy System A — Tauri + Svelte + Python (0.5.x – 0.7.x)

This version introduced a modern desktop architecture before the move to native Swift.

**Stack**
- Frontend: Svelte
- Desktop shell: Tauri
- Backend: Python (Pomodoro engine)
- IPC: JSON-based bridge between frontend and backend

**Reason for deprecation**
While functional, this architecture:
- Added unnecessary complexity on macOS
- Limited deep system integration
- Did not fully match macOS performance and UX expectations

The project has since migrated to **native Swift** for clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

---

### Legacy System B — Python + Tkinter UI (≤ 0.4.x)

This was the **original prototype** used during the earliest stages of development.

**Stack**
- Python
- Tkinter UI
- Single-process desktop app
</details>

## Docs

- Future planning: `docs/Future_Pro_Plan.md`
- Development roadmap: `docs/Roadmap_1.0-2.0.md`
- FAQ & design decisions: `docs/FAQ.md`
- Gatekeeper & installation notes: `docs/Gatekeeper.md`

### Long-term Future Directions

**Orchestrana is free**.

A small number of long-term ideas (AI features, cloud sync, deeper analytics) are being brainstormed.  
**No paid plan exists at this stage.**

Details: `docs/Future_Pro_Plan.md`
