# 🍅 Pomodoro App
**Plan. Focus. Done.**

**Pomodoro App** is a modern, distraction-free Pomodoro & focus timer designed for macOS.  
It features session presets, long-break cycles, productivity summaries, ambient audio, and a macOS-inspired **glass / liquid glass UI**.

Version **1.0.0** marks the first stable milestone after extensive UI, architecture, and workflow refinement.

## Current UI Direction

The current UI uses a structured glass tile system inspired by macOS 26 (liquid glass).

Version 1.0.x+ focuses on:

- Clean up UI
- Updating macOS 15 style to macOS 26 liquid glass.

The goal of upcoming versions is to transition toward a softer, macOS-inspired liquid glass look — with more subtle contrast, improved typography, and refined panel depth.

## Project Status

- Stable for daily use
- Design iterations in progress
- New features in upcoming versions

## 🕰️ Legacy Systems (Archived)

Pomodoro has gone through multiple architectural stages during its development.
All previous implementations are preserved **for reference only** and are no longer
part of the active product direction.

Legacy see: https://github.com/T-1234567890/Pomodoro-legacy

**Status**
- ❌ Deprecated
- ❌ Prototype only
- ❌ No longer representative of the project
- ❌ No longer maintained

The current mainline version of Pomodoro is **fully native Swift (macOS)**.

---

### Legacy System A — Tauri + Svelte + Python (0.5.x – 0.7.x)

This version introduced a modern desktop architecture before the move to native Swift.

**Stack**
- Frontend: Svelte
- Desktop shell: Tauri
- Backend: Python (Pomodoro engine)
- IPC: JSON-based bridge between frontend and backend

**Reason for deprecation**
While functional, this architecture:
- Added unnecessary complexity on macOS
- Limited deep system integration
- Did not fully match macOS performance and UX expectations

The project has since migrated to **native Swift** for clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

---

### Legacy System B — Python + Tkinter UI (≤ 0.4.x)

This was the **original prototype** used during the earliest stages of development.

**Stack**
- Python
- Tkinter UI
- Single-process desktop app

## 🏗️ Working on

### 🖥️ Native liquid glass UI/UX
An upcoming release for the native liquid glass support (currently macOS 15 style)

---

### 🔔 Reminders (In-App Feature — In Progress)
An upcoming in-app reminder system designed to gently notify users of important
events without breaking focus.

Current direction:
- Reminders
- Optional time-based reminders
- Native system notifications (if supported)
- Subtle, non-intrusive behavior by default
- Fully optional and configurable

The reminder system is intended to complement the Pomodoro workflow,
not replace it or become distracting.
