# 🍅 Pomodoro

**Pomodoro** is a macOS productivity app that connects focus sessions, Tasks, Reminders, and Calendar into a single workflow.  
It is not just a timer — it links tasks, time, and focus, adapting to task-driven, time-blocking, or flow-based work styles. Pomodoro is built as a unified time system rather than a rigid productivity method, with a macOS-inspired **glass / liquid glass UI**.

Version **1.1.0** is a feature integration update that deepens system connections without a full redesign.

## ✨ Why Pomodoro App is different

Pomodoro App is designed as a unified time system — not just a timer. It brings together focus sessions, tasks, reminders, and calendar blocks into **one single workflow**, so planning and execution live in the same place.

Instead of forcing a rigid productivity method, Pomodoro App **adapts to how you actually work — whether that’s time-blocking, task-driven planning, or flow-based focus**.

## 🚀 Running the App (1.0.0+ Swift)

Using the official release or running with Xcode

---

### 🔧 Requirements for Developing

Install the following: Xcode, macOS 14.6+

---

## Current UI Direction

The current UI uses a structured glass tile system inspired by macOS 26 (liquid glass).

Version 1.1.x focuses on:

- Deepening Calendar, Reminders, and Tasks integration across the UI
- Clean up UI
- Updating macOS 15 style to macOS 26 liquid glass.

The goal of upcoming versions is to transition toward a softer, macOS-inspired liquid glass look — with more subtle contrast, improved typography, and refined panel depth.

## Project Status

- Stable for daily use
- Design iterations in progress
- New features in upcoming versions

## 🕰️ Legacy Systems (Archived)

Pomodoro has gone through multiple architectural stages during its development.
All previous implementations are preserved **for reference only** and are no longer
part of the active product direction.

Legacy see: https://github.com/T-1234567890/Pomodoro-legacy

**Status**
- ❌ Deprecated
- ❌ Prototype only
- ❌ No longer representative of the project
- ❌ No longer maintained

The current mainline version of Pomodoro is **fully native Swift (macOS)**.

---

### Legacy System A — Tauri + Svelte + Python (0.5.x – 0.7.x)

This version introduced a modern desktop architecture before the move to native Swift.

**Stack**
- Frontend: Svelte
- Desktop shell: Tauri
- Backend: Python (Pomodoro engine)
- IPC: JSON-based bridge between frontend and backend

**Reason for deprecation**
While functional, this architecture:
- Added unnecessary complexity on macOS
- Limited deep system integration
- Did not fully match macOS performance and UX expectations

The project has since migrated to **native Swift** for clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

---

### Legacy System B — Python + Tkinter UI (≤ 0.4.x)

This was the **original prototype** used during the earliest stages of development.

**Stack**
- Python
- Tkinter UI
- Single-process desktop app

## 🏗️ Working on

### 🖥️ Native liquid glass UI/UX
An upcoming release for the native liquid glass support (currently macOS 15 style)

---

### 🔔 Reminders (Improvements)
Continuing to extend the in-app reminder system introduced in v1.1.0 to gently notify users of important
events without breaking focus.

Current direction:
- Feedback
- General update

The reminder system is intended to complement the Pomodoro workflow,
not replace it or become distracting.
